# Arcana-Timeline
Arcana Timeline is a daily reflection app that uses randomly selected tarot cards as prompts for personal insight and journaling.

Each card is generated through an independent random process and does not claim to predict future outcomes.

By presenting one card per day, the app encourages mindful observation rather than instant interpretation.

Users can review past draws through a timeline, supporting long-term reflection and pattern awareness.

Arcana Timeline is designed as a reflective tool, not a fortune-telling service.

Meaning is created through personal understanding, not predefined outcomes.

Each day allows a single draw to preserve independence and clarity.

Limiting frequency reduces cognitive bias and encourages thoughtful reflection rather than repetitive searching for preferred outcomes.

The goal is not more results, but deeper understanding.
